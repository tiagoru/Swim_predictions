Author: Tiago Russomanno

This project represents an initial exploratory analysis focusing on the performance of athletes in the Men's 1500m Freestyle Swimming event. 
Conducted as part of ongoing research and aligned with my role as a data scientist in training, the study aimed to delve into the strategies employed by top swimmers during the competition and how to predict the final time.

## Objectives

- Performance Examination: Perform an in-depth analysis of the performance data for finalists in the Men's 1500m Freestyle and predict the final time
- Pace Strategy Identification: Identify and characterize the pace strategies employed by elite swimmers, highlighting variations for the 1500m race.
- Predict the final time with few features
